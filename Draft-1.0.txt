Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authorization        March 2017


1.  Introduction

   Strong authorization is a method of access control that grants access
   only after multiple factors of authentication and/or authorization
   have been presented.  Authentication factors typically fall into the
   following categories: knowledge (something you know), possession
   (something you have), and inherence (something you are).  Strong
   authorization factors include transaction confirmation and multi-
   party authorization.

   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] is an authorization framework that enables a
   third-party application to obtain limited access to a protected HTTP
   resource.  In OAuth, those third-party applications are called
   clients; they access protected resources by presenting an access
   token to the HTTP resource.  Access tokens are issued to clients by
   an authorization server with the (sometimes implicit) approval of the
   resource owner.  These access tokens are typically obtained by
   exchanging an authorization grant, which represents the authorization
   granted by the resource owner (or by a privileged administrator).

   This specification defines a general framework for the use of strong
   authorization within OAuth 2.0.  It provides a generic mechanism for
   indicating when strong authorization is required.  It defines
   additional extension grant types that allow strong authorization
   credentials to be presented in order to obtain access tokens.

   This use of strong authorization allows authorization servers to
   implement correspondingly strong authorization policies, including
   step-up authentication and transaction confirmation.

   Authorization servers that implement support for resource owner
   password credentials can augment existing password infrastructure by
   requiring a strong second factor of authentication prior to issuing
   access tokens.

   Transaction confirmation can be used to increase the level of
   assurance prior to issuing tokens for highly privileged operations,
   such as a bank withdrawl.  For example, an end-user (resource owner)
   can grant an application (client) access to her account at a
   brokerage firm (resource server).  The application is authorized to
   obtain real-time stock quotes as well as place orders, and is issued
   both an access token and refresh token.  As a matter of policy, the
   access token can be used to obtain stock quotes and is valid for 24
   hours.  Every 24 hour period, the refresh token is used to obtain a
   new access token, so that access to stock quotes is uninterrupted.
   The access token can also be used to place an order, but is subject
   to more stringent security requirements.  Using this extension, the
   refresh token can be used to initiate an authorization session which,

   once confirmed by the user, allows issuance of an access token that
   demonstrates strong authentication and has a limited lifetime.

                     Figure 1: Abstract Protocol Flow

   The abstract strong authorization flow illustrated in Figure 1
   describes the interaction between the resource owner, resource
   server, client, and authorization server and includes the following
   steps:

   (A)  The client obtains authorization from the resource owner.  The
        authorization can be obtained directly from the resource owner
        (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization
        server as an intermediary.  The resource owner's authorization
        is represented as an authorization grant.

   (B)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
        authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.

   (C)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant, and if strong authorization is
        required, returns an error along with an MFA token.

Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authorization        March 2017


   (D)  The resource owner provides the client with a strong
        authorization grant.

   (E)  The client requests an access token from the authorization
        server's token endpoint by including the strong authorization
        grant received from the resource owner along with the MFA token
        received during the prior access token request.  When making the
        request, the client authenticates with the authorization server.

   (F)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the MFA token and strong authorization grant, and if both are
        valid, issues an access token.

   (G)  The client requests the protected resource from the resource
        server and authenticates by presenting the access token.

   (H)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        serves the request.

2.2.  Protocol Endpoints

   The strong authorization process utilizes two authorization server
   endpoints (HTTP resources):

   o  Token endpoint - used by the client to exchange a strong
      authorization grant for an access token, as described in
      Section 3.2 of [RFC6749].

   o  MFA Challenge endpoint - used by the client to obtain a strong
      authorization challenge, the answer to which can be used as a
      strong authorization grant.

3.  Authorization Session

   A client initates an authorization session by sending a token request
   to the token endpoint as described in Section 3.2 of [RFC6749].

3.1.  Token Request

   The client may indicate that it supports strong authentication by
   including the following parameter in the token request to the token
   endpoint.

   mfa_supported

      OPTIONAL.  Indicates that the client support strong
      authentication.

   The following is a non-normative example of a token request (with
   extra line breaks for display purposes only):

   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=password&username=johndoe&password=A3ddj3w&mfa_supported=1

3.2.  Token Error Response

   In addition to the error codes defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749],
   the following error codes are specific multi-factor authorization
   flows:

   mfa_required

      The authorization server requires strong authentication.

   In addition to the response parameters specified by OAuth 2.0, the
   following parameters MUST be included in the response when the error
   code is set to mfa_required:

   mfa_token

      REQUIRED.  The MFA token used to continue the authorization
      session.

   The following is a non-normative example token error response:

   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
   Cache-Control: no-store
   Pragma: no-cache

4.  Obtaining Authorization using Strong Authentication

4.1.  OTP Credentials Grant

   An one-time password is generated by an OTP device, which includes
   hardware devices as well as software-based OTP generators on devices
   such as mobile phones.

4.1.1.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
   following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type

      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-
      type/mfa-otp".

   otp

      REQUIRED.  The one-time password.

   mfa_token

      REQUIRED.  The MFA token received when initiating the
      authorization session.

4.1.2.  Access Token Response

   If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].

4.2.  Out-of-Band Verification Code Grant

   An out-of-band verification code is obtained by challenging an out-
   of-band authenticator.

4.2.1.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
   following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type

      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-
      type/mfa-oob".

   oob_code

      REQUIRED.  The out-of-band verification code.

   mfa_token

      REQUIRED.  The MFA token received when initiating the
      authorization session.

4.2.2.  Access Token Response

   If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].
