1.  Introduction

   Strong authorization is a method of access control that grants access
   only after multiple factors of authentication and/or authorization
   have been presented.  Authentication factors typically fall into the
   following categories: knowledge (something you know), possession
   (something you have), and inherence (something you are).  Strong
   authorization factors include transaction confirmation and multi-
   party authorization.

Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authorization      October 2022


   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] is an authorization framework that enables a
   third-party application to obtain limited access to a protected HTTP
   resource.  In OAuth, those third-party applications are called
   clients; they access protected resources by presenting an access
   token to the HTTP resource.  Access tokens are issued to clients by
   an authorization server with the (sometimes implicit) approval of the
   resource owner.  These access tokens are typically obtained by
   exchanging an authorization grant, which represents the authorization
   granted by the resource owner (or by a privileged administrator).

   This specification defines a general framework for the use of strong
   authorization within OAuth 2.0.  It provides a mechanism for
   indicating when strong authorization is required.  It also provides a
   generic mechanism for obtaining a strong authorization challenge.  It
   defines additional extension grant types that allow strong
   authorization grants to be presented in order to obtain access
   tokens.

   This use of strong authorization allows authorization servers to
   implement correspondingly strong authorization policies, including
   step-up authentication and transaction confirmation.

   Authorization servers that implement support for resource owner
   password credentials can augment existing password infrastructure by
   requiring a strong second factor of authentication prior to issuing
   access tokens.

   Transaction confirmation can be used to increase the level of
   assurance prior to issuing tokens for highly privileged operations,
   such as a bank withdrawl.  For example, an end-user (resource owner)
   can grant an application (client) access to her account at a
   brokerage firm (resource server).  The application is authorized to
   obtain real-time stock quotes as well as place orders, and is issued
   both an access token and refresh token.  As a matter of policy, the
   access token can be used to obtain stock quotes and is valid for 24
   hours.  Every 24 hour period, the refresh token is used to obtain a
   new access token, so that access to stock quotes is uninterrupted.
   The access token can also be used to place an order, but is subject
   to more stringent security requirements.  Using this extension, the
   refresh token can be used to initiate an authorization session which,
   once confirmed by the user, allows issuance of an access token that
   demonstrates strong authentication and has a limited lifetime.

                    Figure 1: Abstract Protocol Flow

   The abstract OAuth 2.0 multi-factor authorization flow illustrated in
   Figure 1 describes the interaction between the resource owner,
   client, authorization server, and resource server and includes the
   following steps:

   (A)  The client requests authorization from the resource owner.  The
        authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner
        (as shown), or indirectly via the authorization server as an
        intermediary.

   (B)  The client receives an authorization grant, which is a
        credential representing the resource owner's authorization.  The
        authorization grant type depends on the method used by the
        client to request authorization and the types supported by the
        authorization server.

   (C)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
        authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.

Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authorization      October 2022


   (D)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant, and if an additional authorization
        grant is required, issues an authorization challenge.

   (E)  The client requests additional authorization from the resource
        owner.  The authorization request is made directly to the
        resource owner.

   (F)  The client receives an additional authorization grant.  The
        authorization grant type depends on the method used by the
        client to request authorization and the types supported by the
        authorization server.

   (G)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
        authorization server and presenting the additional authorization
        grant along with the MFA token received in the authorization
        challenge.

   (H)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant and MFA token, and if both are valid,
        issues an access token.

   (I)  The client requests the protected resource from the resource
        server and authenticates by presenting the access token.

   (J)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        serves the request.

2.  Protocol Endpoints

   The strong authorization process utilizes two authorization server
   endpoints (HTTP resources):

   *  Token endpoint - used by the client to exchange an authorization
      grant, including strong authorization grants, for an access token,
      typically with client authentication.

   *  MFA Challenge endpoint - used by the client to obtain a strong
      authorization challenge, the answer to which can be used as a
      strong authorization grant.

2.1.  Token Endpoint

   The token endpoint is used by the client to obtain an access token by
   presenting its authorization grant or refresh token, as described in
   Section 3.2 of [RFC6749].





Hanson                    Expires 17 April 2023                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authorization      October 2022


   The token endpoint is also used by the client to initiate or continue
   an authorization session.  If the token request is authorized, the
   authorization server responds with a success response as described in
   Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  Otherwise it responds with an error as
   described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].

   In addition to the error codes defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749],
   the following error codes are specific for the strong authorization
   flow:

   mfa_required
      The authorization grant is insufficiently strong, The token
      request MAY succeed if continued using a strong authorization
      grant.

   In addition to the response parameters defined in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC6749], the following parameters MUST be included in the response
   when the error code is set to mfa_required:

   mfa_token
      REQUIRED.  The MFA token used to continue the authorization
      session.

   The following is a non-normative example token error response
   indicating that strong authorization is required:

   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
   Cache-Control: no-store
   Pragma: no-cache

   {
     "error":"mfa_required",
     "mfa_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjFlOWdkazcifQ.eyJpc3Mi

       .IvjKKc54lHvAOCskyEUU8Ou_-8-oXKyFS5bbq-utZPA"
   }

2.2.  MFA Challenge Endpoint

   The MFA challenge endpoint is used by the client to obtain a strong
   authorization challenge.  The answer to this challenge, typically
   obtained by interacting with the resource owner, is a strong
   authorization grant which can be used to obtain an access token by
   presenting it at the token endpoint.



Hanson                    Expires 17 April 2023                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authorization      October 2022


   Use of the MFA challenge endpoint is OPTIONAL; if a client knows of a
   suitable authenticator through an out-of-band mechanism, it can
   obtain a strong authorization grant directly.

2.2.1.  MFA Challenge Request

   The client makes a request to the MFA challenge endpoint by sending
   the following parameters using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   format with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP request entity-
   body:

   mfa_token
         REQUIRED.  The MFA token received from the authorization
         server.

   challenge_type
         OPTIONAL.  The MFA challenge type strings that the client
         supports.  The value of the challenge_type parameter is
         expressed as a list of space-delimited, case-insensitive
         strings.

   authenticator_id
         OPTIONAL.  The identifier of the authenticator to challenge.
         The authorization server MUST ensure that the authenticator is
         associated with the resource owner.

   client_id
         REQUIRED, if the client is not authenticating with the
         authorization server as described in Section 3.2.1 of
         [RFC6749].

   If the client was issued client credentials (or assigned other
   authentication requirements), the client MUST authenticate with the
   authorization server as described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6749].

   For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request (line
   breaks are for display purposes only)::

   POST /challenge HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   mfa_token=eyJhbGciOiJ...&challenge_type=otp%20oob

   The authorization server MUST:

Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authorization      October 2022


   *  require client authentication for confidential clients or for any
      client that was issued client credentials (or with other
      authentication requirements),

   *  authenticate the client if client authentication is included,

   *  ensure the MFA token was issued to the authenticated confidential
      client, or if the client is public, ensure the MFA token was
      issued to client_id in the request,

   *  verify that the MFA token is valid, and

   *  restore the authorization session based on the claims in the MFA
      token.

2.2.2.  MFA Challenge Response

   If the MFA challenge request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server selects an authorization mechanism that would
   satisfy the authorization session, issues a challenge, and constructs
   the response by adding the following parameters to the entity-body of
   the HTTP response with a 200 (OK) status code:

   challenge_type
      REQUIRED.  The type of the authorization challenge issued.  Value
      is case insensitive.

   All additional parameters are specified by the authorization
   challenge type.  This document defines the "otp" type in
   Section 3.1.1, the "oob" type in Section 3.2.1, and the "recovery-
   code" type in TODO.

   The parameters are included in the entity body of the HTTP response
   using the application/json media type as defined by [RFC4627].  The
   response MAY include additional parameters that are interpreted
   according to a challenge type definition.

2.2.3.  MFA Challenge Error Response

   If the MFA challenge request failed client authentication or is
   invalid, the authorization server responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad
   Request) status code (unless specified otherwise) and includes the
   following parameters with the response:

   error
         REQUIRED.  A single ASCII error code from the following:

Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authorization      October 2022


         invalid_request
               The request is missing a required parameter, includes an
               unsupported parameter value (other than challenge type),
               repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials,
               utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the
               client, or is otherwise malformed.

         invalid_authenticator
               The requested authenticator does not exist or is not
               associated with the resource owner.

         invalid_client
               Client authentication failed (e.g. unknown client, no
               client authentication included, or unsupported
               authentication method).  The authorization server MAY
               return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code to indicate
               which HTTP authentication schemes are supported.  If the
               client attempted to authenticate via the Authorization
               request header field, the authorization server MUST
               respond with an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code, and
               include the WWW-Authenticate response header field
               matching the authentication scheme used by the client.

         expired_token
               The provided MFA token is invalid, expired, or revoked.
               The client will need to initiate a new authorization
               session.

         unauthorized_client
               The authenticated client is not authorized to recieve a
               strong authorization challenge.

         unsupported_challenge_type
               The challenge types supported by the client are not
               supported by the authorization server or not available to
               the resource owner.

         association_required
               The resource owner is not associated with any
               authenticator.  The authorization session MAY be
               continued by completing authenticator association.

         server_error
               The authorization server encountered an unexpected
               condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authorization      October 2022


         bad_gateway
               The authorization server received an invalid response
               from an upstream server it accessed in attempting to
               fulfull the request.  This typically occurs when
               challenging an OOB authenticator and the gateway is down,
               for example SMS.

   error_description
         OPTIONAL.  A human-readable ASCII text providing additional
         information, used to assist the client developer in
         understanding the error that occurred.

   error_uri
         OPTIONAL.  A URI identifying a human-readable web page with
         information about the error, used to provide the client
         developer with additional information about the error.

3.  Obtaining Authorization

3.1.  OTP Credentials Grant

   An one-time password is generated by an OTP device, which includes
   hardware devices as well as software-based OTP generators on devices
   such as mobile phones.

3.1.1.  Authorization Challenge

   If the authorization server requires an OTP credential as an
   authorization grant, it responds with an OTP authorization challenge
   containing the following parameters:

   challenge_type
      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "otp".

3.1.2.  User Interaction

   After receiving an OTP challenge, the client prompts or otherwise
   interacts with the resource owner to obtain a one-time password
   generated by a device in the possession of the resource owner.

3.1.3.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
   following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type
      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-
      type/mfa-otp".

   otp
      REQUIRED.  The one-time password.

   mfa_token
      REQUIRED.  The MFA token received when initiating the
      authorization session.

   client_id
      REQUIRED, if the client is not authenticating with the
      authorization server as described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6749].

   If the client was issued client credentials (or assigned other
   authentication requirements), the client MUST authenticate with the
   authorization server as described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6749].

3.1.4.  Access Token Response

   If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].

3.2.  Out-of-Band Verification Code Grant

   An out-of-band verification code is used to obtain authorization via
   an out-of-band authorization ceremony.  Such ceremonys may include
   confirmation via an out-of-band authenticator or multi-party
   authorization.

   An out-of-band authenticator is a device that can communicate
   securely with the authorization server over a secondary channel, such
   as SMS or push notification.

   Multi-party authorization requires approval from a second authorized
   user, in addition to the resource owner, before an action is allowed
   to take place.

   Out-of-band mechanisms are intentionally open-ended, to allow for
   flexibility in how authorization is obtained.  The details of any
   out-out-band mechanism are beyond the scope of this specification.

3.2.1.  Authorization Challenge

   The authorization server orchestrates an out-of-band authorization
   interaction, and responds with a challenge containing the following
   parameters:

   challenge_type
      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "oob".

   oob_code
      REQUIRED.  The out-of-band transaction code generated by the
      authorization server.  The out-of-band transaction code MUST
      expire shortly after it is issued to mitigate the risk of leaks.
      A maximum out-of-band transaction code lifetime of 10 minutes is
      RECOMMENDED.

   binding_method
      OPTIONAL.  The method used to bind the out-of-band channel with
      the primary channel.  The following methods are defined:

      prompt
            The resource owner should be prompted to enter a code
            received via an out-of-band authenticator.

   expires_in
      OPTIONAL.  The duration in seconds of the out-of-band transaction
      code lifetime.

   interval
      OPTIONAL.  The minimum amount of time in seconds that the client
      SHOULD wait between polling requests to the token endpoint.

3.2.2.  User Interaction

   After receiving an out-of-band challenge, the client prompts or
   otherwise interacts with the resource owner to inform them of the
   ongoing authorization ceremony.  Any necessary action by the resource
   owner or other party will depend on the specific out-of-band
   mechanism.

   For example, if confirmation is being obtained via an out-of-band
   authenticator, the resource owner will need to perform an
   authorization gesture on the device in her posession.  If multi-party
   authorization is being performed, the resource owner will need to
   wait until the request is granted by a party with sufficient
   authorization rights.

3.2.3.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
   following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type
      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-
      type/mfa-oob".

   oob_code
      REQUIRED.  The out-of-band verification code.

   binding_code
      REQUIRED, if the binding method of the out-of-band challenge is
      set to prompt.

   mfa_token
      REQUIRED.  The MFA token received when initiating the
      authorization session.

   client_id
      REQUIRED, if the client is not authenticating with the
      authorization server as described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6749].

   If the client was issued client credentials (or assigned other
   authentication requirements), the client MUST authenticate with the
   authorization server as described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6749].

3.2.4.  Access Token Response

   If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].

   In addition to the error codes defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749],
   the following error codes are specific for the out-of-band
   verification code grant:

   authorization_pending
      The authorization request is still pending as the authorization
      ceremony has not yet completed.  The client should repeat the
      Access Token Request to the token endpoint.

Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authorization      October 2022


   slow_down
      The client is polling too quickly and should back off at a
      reasonable rate.

   expired_token
      The "oob_code" or "mfa_token" has expired.  The client will need
      to initiate a new authorization session.

   access_denied
      The resource owner or authorization server denied the request.

3.3.  Recovery Code Grant

   Recovery codes are a physical or electronic set of secrets shared
   between the resource owner and the authorization server.  Recovery
   codes are typically used in the event another authenticator device is
   lost or malfunctions.

3.3.1.  User Interaction

   A user typically signals to the client that they wish to enter a
   recovery flow after realizing that an authenticator device has been
   lost or is malfunctioning.

   Upon receiving this signal from the user, the client prompts or
   otherwise interacts with the resource owner to obtain a recovery
   code.  Such codes are typically already in the resource owner's
   posession, having been previously generated and delivered when
   enrolling an authenticator device.

3.3.2.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
   following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type
      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-
      type/mfa-recovery-code".

   recovery_code
      REQUIRED.  The recovery code.

   mfa_token
      REQUIRED.  The MFA token received when initiating the
      authorization session.

   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].

   In addition to the parameters defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749],
   the following additional parameters are specific for the recovery
   code grant:

   recovery_code
      OPTIONAL.  A newly issued recovery code, in which case the client
      MUST discard the old recovery code and replace it with the new
      recovery code.

4.  Discovery Metadata

   Support for the strong authorization flow MAY be declared in the
   OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [I-D.ietf-oauth-discovery]
   with the following metadata:
