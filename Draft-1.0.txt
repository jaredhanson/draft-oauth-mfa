                 OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authentication
                     draft-hanson-oauth-mfa-latest

Abstract

   This specification provides a framework for the use of strong
   authentication with OAuth 2.0.  Mechanisms are specified for
   initiating an authorization session.  New authorization grant types
   are defined that allow clients to obtain access tokens within the
   context of a strongly authenticated authorization session.

Internet-Draft    OAuth 2.0 Multi-Factor Authentication     January 2017


1.  Introduction

   Strong authentication is a method of access control that grants
   access only after multiple factors of authentication have been
   presented.  The factors typically fall into the following categories:
   knowledge (something you know), possession (something you have), and
   inherence (something you are).

   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] is an authorization framework that enables a
   third-party application to obtain limited access to a protected HTTP
   resource.  In OAuth, those third-party applications are called
   clients; they access protected resources by presenting an access
   token to the HTTP resource.  Access tokens are issued to clients by
   an authorization server with the (sometimes implicit) approval of the
   resource owner.  These access tokens are typically obtained by
   exchanging an authorization grant, which represents the authorization
   granted by the resource owner (or by a privileged administrator).

   This specification defines a general framework for the use of strong
   authentication within OAuth 2.0.  It provides a generic mechanism for
   indicating when strong authentication is required.  It defines
   additional extension grant types that allow strong authentication
   credentials to be presented in order to obtain access tokens.

   This use of strong authentication allows authorization servers to
   implement correspondingly strong authorization policies, including
   step-up authentication and transaction confirmation.

   Authorization servers that implement support for resource owner
   password credentials can augment existing password infrastructure by
   requiring a strong second factor prior to issuing access tokens.

   Transaction confirmation can be used to increase the level of
   assurance prior to issuing tokens for highly privileged operations,
   such as a bank withdrawl.  For example, an end-user (resource owner)
   can grant an application (client) access to her account at a
   brokerage firm (resource server).  The application is authorized to
   obtain real-time stock quotes as well as place orders, and is issued
   both an access token and refresh token.  As a matter of policy, the
   access token can be used to obtain stock quotes and is valid for 24
   hours.  Every 24 hour period, the refresh token is used to obtain a
   new access token, so that access to stock quotes is uninterrupted.
   The access token can also be used to place an order, but is subject
   to more stringent security requirements.  Using this extension, the
   refresh token can be used to initiate an authorization transaction
   which, once confirmed by the user, allows issuance of an access token
   that demonstrates strong authentication and has a limited lifetime.

                     Figure 1: Abstract Protocol Flow

   (A)  The client obtains authorization from the resource owner.  The
        authorization can be obtained directly from the resource owner
        (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization
        server as an intermediary.  The resource owner's authorization
        is represented as an authorization grant.

   (B)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
        authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.

   (C)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant, and if strong authentication is
        required, returns an error along with an MFA token.

   (D)  The resource owner provides the client with a strong
        authentication credential.

   (E)  The client requests an access token from the authorization
        server's token endpoint by including the strong authentication
        credentials received from the resource owner along with the MFA
        token received during the prior access token request.  When
        making the request, the client authenticates with the
        authorization server.

   (F)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the resource owner strong authentication credentials, and if
        valid, issues an access token.

3.  Authorization Session

3.1.  Error Response

   In addition to the error codes defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749],
   the following error codes are specific multi-factor authorization
   flows:

   mfa_required

      The authorization server requires multi-factor authentication.

   When the error code is set to mfa_required, the following parameters
   are included with the response:

   mfa_token

      REQUIRED.  The MFA token used to continue the authorization
      session.

4.  Initiating Authorization using 1st Factor

4.1.  Resource Owner Password Credentials

4.1.1.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request as described in in Section 4.3.2 of
   [RFC6749].

4.1.2.  Access Token Response

   If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].

   If the access token request is unauthorized because policy requires a
   second factor of authentication,...

5.  Obtaining Authorization using 2nd Factor

5.1.  OTP Device

5.1.1.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
   following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type

      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-
      type/2fa-otp".

   otp

      REQUIRED.  The one-time password.

   mfa_token

      REQUIRED.  The MFA token received from the first factor access
      token response.

5.1.2.  Access Token Response

   If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].

5.2.  Out-of-Band Device

5.2.1.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
   following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type

      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-
      type/2fa-oob".

   oob_code

      REQUIRED.  The out-of-band verification code.

   mfa_token

      REQUIRED.  The MFA token received from the first factor access
      token response.

5.2.2.  Access Token Response

   If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].
